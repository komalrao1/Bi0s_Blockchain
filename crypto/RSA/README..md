**1st-Challenge**       
![rsa_1](https://github.com/komalrao1/Bi0s_Blockchain/assets/147682987/01256dfc-adc3-441c-ad7d-021c9957fd98)                      
- Here the challenge is to compute the power 3 of the given number. I have done it by using python.

- Here the challenge is to compute the modulo of (a*b) mod c. I have done it using python.               
**Code**

**3rd-Challenge**                              
![bi0s33](https://github.com/komalrao1/Bi0s_Blockchain/assets/147682987/ec83f8a2-f34f-4aff-a4a2-8a75164a8853)                                 
- Here the challenge is to convert the given number into bytes. Converting integer to bytes is nothing but we will represent the given number as binary number and then we will take each byte binary number and put it as a byte string.
- I have done it using python. The python has a inbuilt *to_byte* method which will convert the integer to bytes. it will take two parameters one is length of number(total number of bytes of that number) and byteorder. byte order is about how we can represent the output byte. if we use byte order as *big* Least significant bit is stored at low memory address. if we use small then least significant bit is stored at high memory address.

- In this level the challenge is to convet the bytes into integer. I have done it using python. python has a inbuilt *int.from_byte()* method. this has two parameters bytestring and byteorder.
